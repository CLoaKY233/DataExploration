## Features

This project covers a wide range of data exploration techniques, including:

- **Data Selection**: Various methods to select and filter data from DataFrames
- **Table Joins**: Different types of joins to combine data from multiple sources
- **Common Fields Analysis**: Techniques to identify and work with shared data across multiple CSV files
- **Aggregation**: Performing summary statistics and grouping operations
- **Window Functions**: Implementing SQL-like window functions for advanced analytics

Each feature is demonstrated through Python scripts and explained in detail in the accompanying documentation.

## Documentation
