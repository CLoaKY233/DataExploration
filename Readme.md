# Data Exploration with Pandas

This project demonstrates various data exploration techniques using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python.

## Current Contents

### 1. DataSelection.py
This script showcases different methods to select specific columns from a pandas DataFrame. It covers:
- Basic column selection
- Using loc and iloc accessors
- Conditional selection

### 2. TableJoin.py
This script demonstrates various types of table joins in pandas, including:
- Inner Join

- Right Join
- Outer Join

## Coming Soon

We're actively working on expanding this project. Here are some topics we'll be covering in the near future:

- ER Diagrams: Understanding and creating Entity-Relationship diagrams
- Primary and Secondary Keys: Exploring the concepts and implementation
- Common Data Among CSV Files: Techniques to find shared data across multiple CSV files
- Aggregate Results: Performing operations like sum, average, max, and min
- Window Functions: Implementing SQL-like window functions in pandas
- Date Manipulation: Working with and transforming date and time data

Stay tuned for updates!
